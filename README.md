# PM Playbook

A playbook I use for all things PM.

## Table of Contents

- [Resources/References](#resources-references)

- [Frameworks](#frameworks)

- [Tools](#tools)

## Resources/References

Work on these resources and references.

## Frameworks

### Working backwards

**One line description**: A framework where you assume the product is already built (implementation details are secondary), and you analyze if it really works for the end user, and if it is better than the alternatives.

**Used by**: Amazon, Apple

**Benefits**:

- Customer focused

- Minimizes confusion

- Goal-oriented

**Steps**:

- Draft a mock-press release detailing the following:

	- The problem you are trying to solve

	- Target users

	- Product benefits to the end user

	- Call to action

- Evaluate the opportunity

- Find solutions (and approvals)

- Build a roadmap

- Create a backlog

## Tools

- Jira + Confluence + GitHub Issues Integration

- <u>Asana</u> (**For task assignment and tracking ??**)
